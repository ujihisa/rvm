  Use <em><a href="/">rvm</a></em>.
  Easy installation and switching between available Ruby versions and runtimes, without messing up your current Ruby install!
  rvm also allows you to use multiple versions of ruby in separate terminals concurrently!
<p>

<h3>Getting started is easy:</h3>
<p> Install the gem </p>
<code>
∴ gem install rvm
  Successfully installed rvm-0.0.38
  1 gem installed
</code>

<p> Install rvm for your current user. </p>
<code>
∴ rvm-install
  (follow prompts)
</code>

<p> Open a new shell and rvm! </p>
<code>
∴ rvm use ruby -v 1.9.1

∴ ruby -v

  ruby 1.9.1p243 (2009-07-16 revision 24175) [x86_64-linux]

∴ which ruby

  /home/wayne/.rvm/ruby-1.9.1-p243/bin/ruby
</code>

<h3>Reverting to system default is simple as well!</h3>

<code>
∴ rvm use default

∴ ruby -v

  ruby 1.8.7 (2008-08-11 patchlevel 72) [universal-darwin10.0]

∴ which ruby

  /usr/bin/ruby
</code>

<h1>Named Gem Sets</h1>
<p> rvm gives you completely separate independent ruby setups.
  This means that ruby, gems, irb are all separate and self contained from system and from each other.</p>

<p>You may even have separate named gem sets.</p>

<p>Lets say for example that you are testing two versions of a gem with ruby 1.9.1.
you can install one to the default 1.9.1 and you can create a named gem set for the other version and switch between them easily.</p>

<h3>Example: testing gems</h3>

<code>
rvm 1.9.1 -m testing
</code>

<p>will use a '1.9.1-testing' gems dir, whereas:</p>

<code>
rvm 1.9.1
</code>

<p>use the normal 1.9.1 gems dir :)</p>

<h3>Example: Rails versions & upgrading apps</h3>

<p>To illustrate the point let's talk about a common use case. Let us assume that we are testing out a rails application in order to upgrade it to the latest Rails from a previous version.  rvm makes such testing very easy as it lets you quickly switch between multiple rails versions. First let us set up the environments.</p>

<code>
rvm 1.9.1
gem install rails # 2.3.3

rvm 1.9.1 -m rails222
gem install rails -v 2.2.2

rvm 1.8.7 -m rails126
gem install rails -v 1.2.6

rvm 1.8.7
gem install rails -v 1.2.3
</code>


<p>Note that above on each ruby installs you can have a completely separate versions!
Now that our environments are setup switching between rails versions and ruby versions is quite simple:</p>

<code>
∴ rvm 1.8.7 -m rails126 ; rails --version

  Rails 1.2.6

∴ rvm 1.8.7 ; rails --version

  Rails 1.2.3

∴ rvm 1.9.1 -m rails220 ; rails --version

  Rails 2.2.0

∴ rvm 1.9.1 ; rails --version

  Rails 2.3.3
</code>

<h2>Warning!!!</h2>
<p> * rvm gives you a separate gem directory for each and every ruby version and gem set.*
  What this means is that gems will have to explicitely installed for each revision and gem set.
</p>

<p> Although I recommend against using it, if you are sure you can use 'rvm gemdup default' and 'rvm gemdup system' to clone user default gems and system gems respectively.</p>

<h2> Gem Sets with passenger </h2>
<p>
  Documented on the <a href="/passenger/">page</a>
</p>

<h2> Managing gem sets </h2>
<p>
  We can not only use completely separate gem sets per application/project/etc... we can also dump and load them easily.
</p>
<h3> Dumping a gem set </h3>
<p>
  To dump a gem set easily, assuming a project called 'albinochipmunk' running on Ruby 1.9.1:
</p>
<code>
∴ rvm 1.9.1 -m albinochipmunk --dump
</code>
<p> will create an 'albinochipmunk.gemset' file. </p>

<h3> Loading a gem set</h3>
<p> To load this gem set simply do: </p>
<code>
∴ rvm 1.9.1 -m albinochipmunk --load albinochipmunk.gemset
</code>
<p> Note that you can use any gem set name to load into. </p>
